> \<model-viewer\> supports and plans to support only glTF/GLB 3D models. It is the Khronos standard known as the JPEG of 3D and the first format to standardize Physically-Based Rendering (PBR), making your models look realistic under any lighting, on any renderer. It is also compact, compressible, and loads rapidly into the GPU.
